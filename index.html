    <h1>Secure yourself against Pushes</h1>
    <p>Here are some tips on how to secure yourself against pushes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be aware of your surroundings and your potential attacker.</li>
      <li>Keep your hands up.</li>
      <li>Step back and off-line.</li>
      <li>Block the push.</li>
      <li>Counterattack.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to remember that no one technique is guaranteed to work in every situation. The best way to secure yourself against a push is to be aware of your surroundings, keep your hands up, and be prepared to react quickly. With practice, you will be able to develop your own personal defense strategy that will help you to stay safe in any situation.</p>
    <p>Here are some additional tips that may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are being pushed from behind, try to turn around and face your attacker.</li>
      <li>If you are being pushed to the ground, try to fall in a way that will protect yourself.</li>
      <li>If you are being pushed by a group of people, try to create distance between yourself and your attackers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important thing is to stay calm and think clearly. If you can do that, you will be more likely to secure yourself successfully.</p>
